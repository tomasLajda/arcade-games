# 2D Game Engine

Welcome to the repository for my 2D game engine project! This project was developed from scratch using C++ and SDL2, with the goal of creating a flexible and efficient engine for 2D game development.

## Overview

This game engine was built from the ground up, starting with the basics of rendering graphical elements like shapes, lines, and points. I also implemented custom vector logic to manage these elements more effectively. The engine includes key features such as:

- **Game Scene Management**: Handling transitions and logic between different game scenes.
- **Basic Rendering System**: Capable of drawing 2D shapes, handling textures, and managing sprites.

## Demonstration Projects

To showcase the engine's capabilities, I developed two classic games:

### Breakout Game

As an initial demonstration, I created a classic Breakout game. This project highlights the engine's ability to handle:

- **Rendering**: Drawing and updating game elements on the screen.
- **Controls**: Managing player inputs for paddle movement and ball interaction.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Implementing collision detection, ball physics, and brick destruction.

### Tetris Game

As a follow-up project, I used the engine to develop a Tetris game, which further pushed the engine's capabilities. Key features of this game include:

- **Block Rotation and Movement**: Smoothly rotating and moving tetrominoes.
- **Line Clearing**: Detecting and clearing completed lines, with cascading effects.
- **Scoring System**: Tracking player scores based on cleared lines.
- **Level Progression**: Increasing game difficulty as the player advances through levels.

## Learning Experience

Developing this engine and the accompanying games provided me with a deep understanding of game mechanics and design. It was a valuable opportunity to refine my development skills, particularly in C++ and SDL2, and to explore the complexities of game engine architecture.
